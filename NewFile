***Fork A Repo***

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Propose changes to someone else's project

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.
If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.

In fact, when you create a repository on GitHub, you have a choice of automatically including a license file, which determines how you want your project to be shared with others.

Fork an example repository

Forking a repository is a simple two-step process. We've created a repository for you to practice with!

On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.
Fork buttonIn the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.

Keep your fork synced

You might fork a project in order to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same octocat/Spoon-Knife repository you just forked!

Step 1: Set Up Git

If you haven't yet, you should first set up Git. Don't forget to set up authentication to GitHub from Git as well.

Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork

Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository on your computer. Let's create a clone of your fork locally on your computer.

On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.

Clone URL buttonUnder your repository name, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.

Open Terminal.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife
Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife
Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository!

Step 3: Configure Git to sync your fork with the original Spoon-Knife repository

When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or upstream, repository into the local clone of your fork.

On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.

Clone URL buttonUnder your repository name, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.

Open Terminal.

Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned in Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork.

To go to your home directory, type just cd with no other text.
To list the files and folders in your current directory, type ls.
To go into one of your listed directories, type cd your_listed_directory.
To go up one directory, type cd ...
Type git remote -v and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.

git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
Type git remote add upstream, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 and press Enter. It will look like this:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type git remote -v again. You should see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream.

git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)
Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands. For more information, see "Syncing a fork."





***Adding a file to a repository from the command line***

On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.
Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local repository.

Stage the file for the first commit to your repository.

git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin


***Syncing a fork***

Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

Before you can sync your fork with an upstream repository, you must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git.

Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.

git fetch upstream
remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY
 * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
Check out your fork's local master branch.

git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

git merge upstream/master
Updating a422352..5fdff0f
Fast-forward
 README                    |    9 -------
 README.md                 |    7 ++++++
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 README
 create mode 100644 README.md
If your local branch didn't have any unique commits, Git will instead perform a "fast-forward":

git merge upstream/master
Updating 34e91da..16c56ad
Fast-forward
